/**
 * @file capicola_manual.cpp
 * @brief The firmware-authored interactive manual.
 *
 * Prose and panel metadata, carried in the HostLink descriptor and rendered
 * by the web programmer alongside the live module. Ranges, units, defaults,
 * colors and labels are NOT restated here — the host reads those straight
 * from the control declarations in main.cpp. This file adds only what a
 * reader cannot infer from the panel.
 *
 * Panel jacks and buttons are declared here rather than in main.cpp:
 * alchemy::Jack is pure descriptor metadata (no state, no runtime, no
 * schema-hash impact), and Capicola's three buttons are hand-driven in
 * main.cpp's poll hook, so their VirtualButtons carry no ButtonBank state
 * either. Both exist solely to be documented.
